## Overview

This project is a Front End Mentor coding challenge where I aimed to reproduce a similar desktop design. The goal was to build out the QR Code component and get it looking almost identical to the original design.

## My process
When I started this challenge, I didn't realize how unstructured my HTML code was. So I started from scratch. To better visualize the structure of the content, I printed a copy of the recipe challenge and physically cut out different sections of the design. My hands on approach helped me plan the layout more effectively.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

It's super basic: without proper semantic elements, styling the page becomes inefficient and confusing.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on cleaning up my CSS code. I caught areas where I'd repeat margin and padding properties uncessarily.
